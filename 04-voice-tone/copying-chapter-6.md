# VI Copying

We can distinguish between copying and inspiration, these are two different things.
But quite similar and everyone has a different border between them.

There is nothing wrong with copying if we do it right, it is an everyday activity nowadays.
Only when we see some nice clothes, t-shirt or shoes on someone. And do we go buy it, copy our style 
or get inspired and then start combining it with our wardrobe and create our own style?
This is also true in the world of graphic artists. There is a fine line between copying and copyright infringement.
So that we perceive copying only in that bad light, it is also a great tool for learning something new or improving our skills.

# Short story

Even from my own experience, I found myself on the brink of copyright infringement. Over the past year, I created the first illustrated character, 
from a template from one that I photographed on the instagram. I drew it all over again, but the outlines were similar, they only differed in certain 
aspects and in color, I adapted it to my own figure. I added it to the instagram and set it as a profile picture. Somehow I did not pay attention 
to it and I do not have any great impact in my posts or many followers. But at the end of the year, the author of my draft contacted me, 
for a very long time with a message, she also used vulgar words and she also turned to the fact that it is discrimination within where she lives, etc ..

In the end, my laziness won and I did not even reply to the message, I just deleted the post and changed my profile photo. With my broken English,
I could not imagine how we would argue, and I reinforced it by redrawing everything by hand. I was still worried about the instagram message if it reported
me and I threatened to delete the account or restrict it. I realize that in this case, my inspiration has turned into a certain coping. But i do not think
Iam the only one and that similiar cases happen every day.

Therefore, if we publish any of our graphic or written work, we must take into account the greater risk of possible copying.
