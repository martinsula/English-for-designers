## About 


Every project is a challenge for me, which moves me and changes my view in graphic design for the better.

I am a graphic and media design student in Prague. I have no problem working in a team and I am always excited to learn new things.
I consider myself open, creative and sometimes a little cryzy man. Sometimes I do not think about things that 
much and I just act. I am rather quiet, but if I say something, it is worth it. I am passionately collecting
vinyl records, I like to try new things, traveling, playing games, make things and collecting experiences.
