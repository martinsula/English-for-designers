Hi my name is Martin

I talked about my work in graphic design many times and I dont know what else I can show you from my works, so I decided to introduce you my sports activities. 

Someone already know, I have been involved in yachting since I was 8 years old. This photo is from my biggest races, which entered the book of guinness world records, when over a thousand boats were registered for the races.

Yachting has brought me countless experiences both in the form of various certificates (survival course on the ship, ship-boarding or surface rescue assistant) and beautiful unforgettable experiences, one of which you can see. There will be bad ones, of course, such as passing through the storms. Even a change of perspective on the environment, which is why my dad and I decided to start a small company to monitor water pollution and promote the new technologies to prevent it.

Even though I donot do much yachting during school, I still have certain goals that I'd like to accomplish. Maybe take a ride on one of these boats.

Now I've been active in crossfit for a year and a half

what a crossfit is?

Crosffit is a combination of everything, i think.

it is a combination of intensive interval training, weightlifting, plyometrics, powerlifting, gymnastics (hand stand walk, ring muscle up), calistenics, strongmans and other exercises such as shooting (squirrel rifle like in biatlon, swimming, cycling and over the years will definitely invent other things)

Most people think of it as a crossfit. 
Some people think there's a very bad sport, because quite quickly you can hurt yourself.
This sport can bring you a lot of skills, not every practice is done all that technically and the speed and number of reps is preferred. I think it is suitable for people who have been practising for some time and can handle their technical. It's definitely not suitable for someone who's starting to do workout.

What do yo need for crossfit.
Basicialy nothing. Just find the nearest licensed gym, register on the ramp (on ramp, is such an introduction to the crossfit, where I will show you certain exercises as they should be done) and ofcourse you need some sportswear.

How to identify a crossfiter?
When you start doing crossfit for a while you will find that you need a few things and it will look similar

Her is my set up. 

Here's my gym I regularly visit Located on prague 9

They train two of the best crossfit athletes here, David stroupek and Sona Karasková, who were the first Czech to participate in the biggest races in the world. In last year.

Which are called crossfit games, crossfit functions as a brand, has no union and is therefore not included in the Olympic Games. Also because it doesn't have steady exercises and therefore we can see something new on every crossfit games. Last year they were opened for the first time for the international part, otherwise they were only for America.

When you win this games you gets the award the fittest man or woman on earth. Here are their biggest faces Rich Froning Jr.  He became the first person to win the title of "Fittest Man on Earth" four times. Mathew Fraser, that he has the same number of wins and now to overcome 5 wins in a row. Tia-Clair Toomey, she has 4 wins in a row.

This year, I and my friend took part in our first official races. Under Team Named Zacvičíme uvidíme.

It was a two-day race, ranked among the largest pairs race in the Czech Republic, located in the Yellow resort in Prague and in three different categories, we were in the sport group.

A day or two before the races you will learn the individual wods (disciplines). this is how they can look. Sometimes it's more like a Harry Potter riddle during a cup of fire. Within two days we had a total of 6 wods

This is the place where the individual wods take place, sometimes they take place outside the area.
here's a little sample of our synchronization. (on the bar is around 50kg, sometimes even smaller strategies are useful)

After each workout, you must sign a paper to the referee in which you agree to the number of repetitions. Sometimes it looks like a fresco from a Michelangelo.

Sometimes my friend and I seemed to enjoy it very much

Thanks to sports, I have a lot of great people around me who support me and make up my second family

One interesting thing about me…
Some of you may have noticed, but I wear specific socks during my workout. I wear them whenever I go to training, I have different color combinations of course. It's because exercises is like an addictive drug for me, but we all have something similar and it doesn't have to be just exercise.

Thank you for your attention, and do things that you enjoy, even if they can sometimes be a challenge for us, just so you can move on
